[Quick](https://github.com/Quick/Quick) + [Nimble](https://github.com/Quick/Nimble) + [SwiftCheck](https://github.com/typelift/SwiftCheck) = **QuickSwiftCheck**.

## Requirements

QuickSwiftCheck is written in Swift 4.1 and supports **macOS 10.10+**, **iOS 8.0+**, **tvOS 9.0+** and **Linux**.

## Usage

QuickSwiftCheck allows you to use [Quick](https://github.com/Quick/Quick) DSL and [Nimble](https://github.com/Quick/Nimble) expectations together with [SwiftCheck](https://github.com/typelift/SwiftCheck):

```swift
sc_it("Int.hashValue should respect the axiom") {
    forAll { (x: Int, y: Int) in
        (x == y) ==> expect(x.hashValue).sc_to(equal(y.hashValue))
    }
}
```

QuickSwiftCheck adds `sc_` variants to `it`, `fit`, `xit`, `to` and `toNot` functions, so that the original functions remain not overloaded (because doing so causes type checking ambiguities). This means you can use `it` to create a regular test example and `to` to create a regular expectation:

```swift
it("this is a regular test example") {
    expect(...).to(...)
}
```

```swift
sc_it("this is a property-based test example") {
    forAll {
        expect(...).sc_to(...)
    }
}
```
